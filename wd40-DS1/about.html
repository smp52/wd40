		    <h2>Founders</h2>
            <h3>Rich Miller:</h3>
            <p>Rich is a lifelong paddler and camping enthusiast, and has operated the premier Central Florida paddling tour company, Kissimmee River Kayak, LLC, for over 8 years. He was a founding member of the Osceola Blueways Committee formed to investigate establishing an extended paddling trail stretching from Shingle Creek to the Everglades, with adjacent hiking and biking trail and associated camp sites. When his two sons were young and wanting to ride off-road BMX bikes, Rich was instrumental in developing and managing what eventually became a highly successful and nationally recognized BMX bike track, located in St. Cloud, Florida, located just East of Kissimmee. Due to his vision of a potential Osceola Blueways trail and extensive tour guide experience, Rich will oversee paddling tour operations from individual rentals to medium and large groups.</p>

            <h3>John Jacobs (aka JJ or Dr. J):</h3>
            <p>John is recreational paddler, off-road mountain biker and for the past 4 years served as a support tour guide assisting Rich on selected tour excursions involving larger groups of paddlers. He is an Organizational Psychologist with over 20 years consulting experience helping small, medium, and large businesses/corporations and government agencies to implement effective business processes, to include developing and validating assessment and training instruments. John was a faculty member at the University of Central Florida's Institute for Simulation (UCF-IST) for 9 years and was awarded Researcher of the Year in 2000. Johnâ€™s background and experience are well suited to his main role overseeing business operations, to include marketing and sales. He will also be integrally involved with day-to-day operations. His background in developing interactive simulation- and game-based instruction programs will be invaluable when developing and promoting edutainment experiences for the expected variety of groups seeking this unique Shingle Creek venue, such as corporate team building, family/military reunions, K-12 summer camps, etc.</p>
