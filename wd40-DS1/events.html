           <h2>Paddling Information</h2>
            <p>We hope you enjoy all the paddling options we offer at The Paddling Center. All paddling platforms are highly durable and stable and come with Coast Guard approved Personal Floatation Devices and appropriate equipment for the given platform. Both paddling and basic safety instructions are given prior to launching so no paddling experience is necessary.</p>

            <p>Tour guides are available but only via advanced reservation of at least 24 hours (sometimes up to a week or more) for larger groups or specialty groups (e.g., corporate team building). There is a 2 hour minimum for both kayak and canoe rentals.</p>

            <p>Our vision and goal for each one of our tours is to blend information about eco, culture, and history into an entertaining narrative that is spiced with a little humor.

        <div class="duffy_ride">
            <h4>Duffy Electric Boat Ride</h4>
            <p>Our electric boat may carry up to eight guests for tours lasting between 45-50 minutes. Tours run north of The Paddling Center for up to 1.5 miles and (if Creek conditions allow) South of the Paddling Center up to 1.5 miles. The boat captain will provide edu-tainment narrative that covers local history/lore and ecological facts about the Creek and surrounding flora, fauna, and wildlife. Tours may be only edu-tainment oriented (fun and interesting, not too deep), or may have a special flavor, such as picture taking, bird watching, etc. We also may have opportunities to include individuals (local ecologist, graduate biology/environmental science students, etc.) to offer more in-depth and focused narrative. Our Duffy boat runs silently through the water at reduced speeds (6mph and below) and will slow or stop for picture taking, wildlife viewing, etc. as needed.</p>

        <div class="kayak_canoe">
            <h4>Kayak/Canoe Tours</h4>
            <p>At The Paddling Center we offer both 2 hour guided tours of Shingle Creek and 3-4 hour guided training tours to Makinson Island. In order to maximize the enjoyment of each of our guests, we do limit the number of persons and boats that each guide/instructor can accompany on the water. Our maximum ratios are listed below.
            </p>

            <P>Adults - 12 people per guide / 6 boats per guide</P>

            <P>Kids - 10 people per guide / 5 boats per guide</P>

            <p>The quantities above reflect the maximum number of persons and boats that each guide may accompany.Adult Boats are classified as any boat (canoe or kayak) with at least one adult age 15 and older. If you do not wish to hire enough guides to cover the number of people or boats in your group, you may designate a portion of your group to be under the purview of the guide. The other members of your group may not remain in the vicinity of the guide.</p>
